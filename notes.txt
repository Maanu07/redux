* redux is a library that is used to manage state in our application.
* redux can be implemented with any javascript application.
* redux is not limited to only react.
* redux is a predicitve state container library for js applications.
* in simple language redux is a store where all the states of the application are kept at a single place.
* redux toolkit makes it easier to implement redux.
* react-redux library is used to bind react and redux/redux toolkit

* Three core concepts in redux are : store, action , reducer 
* store is a place where all the states of the application will be stored
* action describes what has happened in the application 
* reducer takes the action and returns the new state of the application



********************************

* Three principles of redux:
  1. the state of application will be a single js object which will be managed by redux store 
  2. the application cannot directly update the state, they have to dispatch a action which will tell what to do 
  3. reducer is a pure function that takes the initial state and the action and therefore returns the new state of the application 

  

  ******************************************

  * Video 5 
  * action is a js object with a 'type' attribute that tells what action has happened 
  * action is created using a action creator 
  * action creator is a function that returns the action object 


  *******************************************

  * Video 6 
  * reducer is a pure function that takes prev state and action object to return a new state of the application


  ******************************************

  * redux store contains the entire state of the application 
  * we have to use redux library to create a redux store
  * redux.createStore(reducer) method creates a redux store, we have to pass the reducer method as a argument 
  * to get the current state from store, we can run store.getState() method 
  * we need to add a subscribe method to our redux store that will be called whenever the state changes 
  * store.subscribe(function), it takes a function  as argument 
  * now to invoke an action we need to call store.dispatch(action_creator) method 
  * we also have unsubscribe method which removes subscribe method from the store


  ************************************************

  * Video 9 
  * bindActionCreators() is a helper funcion that lets you bind all the action creators to the store.dispatch() method 
  * it is a optional function
  * this function is exported by redux  library



  **************************************************

  * Video 10,12,12
  * we can create multiple reducer functions to manage our state change easily for large application 
  * but redux store takes only one reducer as a argument 
  * therefore we need a function to combine these reducers function together
  * we can import combineReducers() method from redux library to combine 2 or more reducers 
  * let rootReducer = combineReducers({key:value,key:value})
  * createStore(rootReducer)
